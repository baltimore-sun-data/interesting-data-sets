# interesting-data-sets
This is a stub. The core of this repository will likely be a JSON file of urls for interesting public data sets, of interest to those who follow the news in the Mid-Atlantic region. We will probably create some sorts of alerts based on these, with the idea of hooking projects atop them when they change.
